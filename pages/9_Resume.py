Building a Siamese Neural Network for Face Verification

*Self-initiated project*

- â–º Built a Siamese network, specifically designed for comparing similarities. With twin subnetworks generating 
embeddings and a tailored loss function, it excelled in facial recognition.

- â–º By crafting a training dataset, incorporating data augmentation, and utilizing VGGFace for feature 
extraction, I improved the modelâ€™s accuracy. 

- â–º The Siamese architecture, coupled with a custom training loop, yielded remarkable average recall and 
precision on the test set â€” 99% and 100% respectively.

- â–º Real-time testing demonstrated the modelâ€™s practical utility.

Arabic Word-level Sign Language Recognition

*End of Year project*

- â–º Worked on the largest dataset for word-level Arabic sign language recognition, containing 502 words 
performed by three signers. I used the 100 words subset of this dataset for experiments.

- â–º Leveraged mediapipe's holistic model to extract the hand and pose landmarks and used them to train a 
Bidirectional LSTM model. Setting Adam optimizer, categorical_crossentropy loss and categorical_accuracy metric.

- â–º Achieved 99.6% accuracy on the test set and 0.026 loss.

- â–º Examined the generalization ability of our model, testing its performance with unseen persons and under 
different conditions. This exploration uncovered areas for improvement, which we will focus on in the future.

algorithm.
- â–º In the second course, I was introduced to more advanced learning algorithms, including neural networks,
decision tree ensembles. I also gained insights into key machine learning concepts such as bias and 
variance, cross-validation, and improving learning algorithms' efficiency.
- â–º In the final course I got introduced to clustering algorithms, anomaly detection algorithms, collaborative filtering
and content-based filtering, and in the last week, reinforcement learning.

- â–º In this track, I learned how to manipulate data, write efficient Python code, and work with
challenging data, including date and time data, text data, and web data using APIs. 
- â–º As my skills grew, I progressed to writing Python functions and unit testingâ€”an essential skill needed to find
bugs in your code before your users do! 
- â–º Through interactive exercises, I gained experience working with powerful Python libraries, including NumPy, pytest, and pycodestyle, that helped me perform
key programmer tasks such as web development, data analysis, and task automation.
