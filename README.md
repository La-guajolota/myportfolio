## Overview  
This portfolio is based on the original repository created by **[Issam Jebnouni](https://issam-jebnouni.streamlit.app/)**, to whom I am grateful for sharing his work. The original project was designed as an extension of a resume, showcasing achievements and projects through a web application built with **Streamlit**, a simple Python-based framework.  

### Credits

### Modifications and Customization  
I have made several modifications and customizations to adapt the original project to my personal needs and preferences. These include:  
- **Design personalization**: Updated the appearance and visual elements to match my personal style.  
- **Content update**: Added my own achievements, projects, and descriptions.  
- **New features**: Made small improvements to the code structure to align with my specific goals.  

### Why Streamlit?  
Streamlit allowed me to focus on improving my project models rather than dealing with complex web code. Its user-friendly features enabled me to develop this application quickly and efficiently. Moreover, its ability to share web applications directly from Python code makes it an ideal tool for showcasing data science projects.
