# portfolio [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://issam-jebnouni.streamlit.app/)
## Overview
I created this portfolio to be an extension of my resume, showing my achievements and projects. Streamlit, a simple Python-based framework, helped me focus on improving my project models instead of dealing with complicated web code. It had easy-to-use features that made development easier, and sharing through a Python code allowed me to quickly display my work to more people. Streamlit makes it possible for anyone to turn their data science projects into polished web apps, making it a great choice for my portfolio.
